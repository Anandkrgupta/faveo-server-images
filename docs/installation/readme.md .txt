## Requirements

If you don't want to use Docker, the best way to setup the project is to use the same configuration that [Homestead](https://laravel.com/docs/homestead) uses. Basically, Monica depends on the following:

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
* PHP 7.3+
* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
* [MySQL 5.7](https://www.mysql.com/)
* Optional: Redis or Beanstalk

## Installation instructions for specific platforms

The preferred OS distribution is Cent OS 8, simply because all the development is made on it and we know it works. However, any OS that lets you install the above packages should work.
