    Faveo-Helpdesk CentOS 7 MySQL configuration quick-help.

    Default MySQL root password after installation is not set, thus empty.

    Make sure you set a root password and remember it as it's very hard for
    the common user to change. Ensure your password is a secure one, too.

    Unless you know what you are doing, the answers to the questions after
    you've set up the root password should most likely be answered by YES
    or "y" for a typical, secure installation.
