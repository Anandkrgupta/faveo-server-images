    Faveo-Helpdesk Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial MySQL configuration quick-help.

    You should have set MySQL root password while installing.

    Make sure you remember your root password as it's very hard for the
    common user to change. Ensure your password is a secure one, too.

    If you want to change your root password, for some reason, answer Y
    to the first question. Otherwise answer by the negative.

    Unless you know what you are doing, answers to the questions after
    the root password question should most likely ALL be answered by YES
    or "y" for a typical, secure installation.
